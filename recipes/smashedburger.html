    <h2>Burger that no one can resist</h2>
    <p><strong>Smash burgers!</strong> Who doesn't like that? Today you will follow my
         <strong>SICK</strong> recipe!</p>
         <h3><strong>Smash Burgers Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong></li>
            <p>We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty
                 burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up
                  to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty
                   burgers).</p>
            <li><strong>Sauce</strong></li>
            <p>A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what
                 we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</p>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong></li>
            <p>we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers,
                 but you can use American-style cheese or your
                  favorite sliced cheese.</p>
            <li><strong>Buns</strong></li>
            <p>Brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger
                 look, but any burger bun will work</p>
            <li><strong>Lettuce</strong></li>
            <p>thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style
                 smash burger</p>
            <li><strong>Pickles</strong></li>
            <p>sliced dill pickle chips are the best</p>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong></li>
            <p>Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and
                 cut them into rings</p>
            <li><strong>Red onion</strong></li>
            <p>Thinly sliced into rings</p>
         </ul>
         <h4><strong>How to make Samsh Burgers step-by-step</strong></h4>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Patties</strong></li>
            <p>Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions
                 (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready
                  to cook.</p>
            <li><strong>Make Sauce</strong></li>
            <p>Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set
                 aside.</p>
            <li><strong>Prep Toppings </strong></li>
            <p>fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers
                 right away while the patties are hot and juicy off
                  the grill.</p>
            <li><strong>Toast buns</strong></li>
            <p>lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on
                 a griddle or skillet over medium heat until
                  golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</p>
            <li><strong>Cook patties</strong></li>
            <p>increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface
                 area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot
                  surface. Working quickly, cover each piece
                   with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each
                    into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season
                     with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab
                      of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the
                       first side and about a minute on the second
                        side.</p>
            <li><strong>Add cheese</strong></li>
            <p>place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and
                 top with a second patty and remove from heat.
                  Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</p>
