    <h2>Beautiful Meatballs</h2>
    <p>There is nothing better than <strong>REAL</strong> <em>Swedish meatballs,</em> and today
         we will go through how a real Swede makes them.</p>
         <h3><strong>Meatballs Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground beef</strong></li>
            <p>The main protein base for the meatballs, providing
                 flavor and texture.</p>
            <li><strong>Panko bread crumbs</strong></li>
            <p>Adds lightness and helps bind the meatballs together.</p>
            <li><strong>Parsley</strong></li>
            <p>I use fresh parsley to enhance the taste.</p>
            <li><strong>Ground allspice</strong></li>
            <p>Introduces a warm, slightly sweet flavor.</p>
            <li><strong>Ground nutmeg</strong></li>
            <p>Adds a subtle nutty, warm flavor that complements the
                 beef.</p>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong></li>
            <p>This surprisingly adds a slight sweetness to the
                 meatballs.</p>
            <li><strong>Garlic powder</strong></li>
            <p>You canâ€™t go wrong with garlic!</p>
            <li><strong>Pepper</strong></li>
            <p>This adds in some mild heat.</p>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <p>The salt enhances all of the flavors of the ingredients
                 in the Swedish meatballs.</p>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong></li>
            <p>Acts as a binder to hold the meatball mixture
                 together.</p>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
            <p>Used for cooking the meatballs, adding flavor and helps
                 the meatballs to brown.</p>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong></li>
            <p>Adds richness and helps in browning the meatballs.</p>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong></li>
            <p>Combined with butter to create a roux, the flours helps
                 thicken the sauce.</p>
            <li><strong>Beef broth</strong></li>
            <p>Adds depth of flavor and forms the liquid base of the
                 sauce.</p>
            <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong></li>
            <p>Provides a creamy texture and rich flavor.</p>
            <li><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong></li>
            <p>Adds a tangy, savory depth to the sauce.</p>
            <li><strong>Dijon mustard</strong></li>
            <p> Introduces a slight tang to the sauce without being
                 overwhelming.</p>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></li>
            <p>Essential for seasoning and balancing the flavors
                 of the sauce.</p>
         </ul>
         <h4><strong>How to make the Meatballs step by step</strong></h4>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine beef, egg and seasonings:</strong></li>
            <p>In a medium sized bowl combine ground beef, panko,
                 parsley, allspice, nutmeg, onion, garlic powder,
                  pepper, salt and egg. Mix until combined.</p>
            <li><strong>Roll and cook:</strong></li>
            <p>Roll into 12 large meatballs or 20 small meatballs.
                 In a large skillet heat olive oil and 1 Tablespoon
                  butter. Add the meatballs and cook turning
                   continuously until brown on each side and cooked
                    throughout. Transfer to a plate and cover with
                     foil.</p>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong></li>
            <p>Add 4 Tablespoons butter and flour to skillet and whisk
                 until it turns brown. Slowly stir in beef broth and
                  heavy cream. Add worchestershire sauce and
                   dijon mustard and bring to a simmer until sauce
                    starts to thicken. Salt and pepper to taste.</p>
            <li><strong>Add meatballs and simmer:</strong></li>
            <p> Add the meatballs back to the skillet and simmer for
                 another 1-2 minutes. Serve over egg noodles
                  or rice.</p>
